Installation instructions for UseModWiki 1.0
Last updated: September 11, 2003
See the UPGRADE file for instructions to upgrade an existing wiki.

------
New Installations:

The following instructions should work for most UNIX-based systems.
See http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?UseModWiki/InstallWindows for
instructions if you are installing under Microsoft Windows.

1. Copy the file "wiki.pl" to your cgi-bin directory.  You can rename
   the file to another name if you like.  (Some servers may require
   the name to end in ".pl" or ".cgi".)

2. For some servers, you may need to change the permissions on the wiki.pl
   script.  (The command "chmod 755 wiki.pl" should be correct.)

3. Create the wiki database directory.  This directory must be writable
   by the wiki CGI script.  (You may need to use another chmod command.)
   If the directory does not exist, the script will attempt to create it.

4. If your installation of Perl is not located in /usr/bin/perl, you will
   need to change the "/usr/bin/perl" text in the first line of wiki.pl.
   (On UNIX-like systems this is usually unnecessary.  For Windows,
    "#!perl" (without the quotes) may also work.)

5. Edit the "wiki.pl" file.  The configuration section starts around
   line 60.  The main configuration variable is:

   $DataDir     = "/tmp/mywikidb";     # Main page database

   ... which is the wiki database directory.  The default directory is
   in /tmp, which is not a good location for a long-term wiki.  (Many
   systems will erase the contents of /tmp when they crash or reboot.)
   Change this directory to the one you created in step 3, using the
   full path name, like "/home/domainname/www/wikidb".

6. Most of the wiki's configuration variables can be stored and edited
   outside the script.  (You still need to edit the script to set the
   $DataDir variable.)  To do this, copy the "config" file to your wiki's
   $DataDir directory and edit it.

   The advantage of editing the config file (rather than the script) is that
   upgrades to future versions are much easier--you only need to make the
   changes above rather than re-edit all of your local configuration.

   You will probably want to change the following configuration values:

   $CookieName  = "Wiki";       # Name for this wiki (for multi-wiki sites)

   ... If your site uses multiple copies of UseModWiki, you must
       make sure that each copy has a unique $CookieName.  The
       cookies store user-specific settings and preferences.

   $SiteName    = "Wiki";       # Name of site (used for titles)

   ... This name is used in the title of every page.

   $HomePage    = "HomePage";   # Home page (must be valid LinkPattern)

   ... This is the name of the wiki page users will go to when:
       * The user clicks on the logo image, or
       * The user does not specify a page in their URL.

   $LogoUrl     = "/wiki.gif";  # URL for site logo ("" for no logo)

   ... This is the URL for the logo image.  If it is "", the logo will
   not be displayed.

7. If you are installing the wiki on a web server using a non-standard
   port number (like 8080), then you must also set $FullUrl to the
   full path of your wiki, like:

   $FullUrl = "http://www.mydomain.com:8080/cgi-bin/wiki.pl";

   If you are using a non-standard port and do not set $FullUrl, then
   the wiki may not go to the right URL after editing a page.

   (If your site's URLs are like "http://www.mydomain.com/pagename"
    (without a number like "8080"), then you should not need to
    modify the $FullUrl setting.)

8. If you wish to use the provided wiki.gif image, copy it to the top
   directory of your www pages.  (Or see step 6 to change the LogoUrl
   variable.)

9. (Optional) To use the supplied InterWiki site definitions, copy the
   file "intermap" into the database directory (from step 3).

10. Start your web browser, and go to the URL of the wiki.pl script.
    You should be able to edit and add new pages.

------
Likely Problems:

[Note that the path names (like /tmp/mydb/mywikidb) may be different
 in your error messages.]

1. The output message:
   Could not go to or create /tmp/mydb/mywikidb: No such file or directory
...means that the database directory in step 5 above did not exist, 
   and the wiki script could not create the directory.

2. The output message:
   Could not go to or create /tmp/mydb/mywikidb: Permission denied
...means that the database directory exists, but it does not have the
   proper permissions for the script to read it.

3. If you see the message:
   can't make /tmp/mydb/mywikidb/lock: Permission denied
...when saving a page, it means that the script could not write to
   the database directory.

4. If you can save your changes, but you do not see the changed page after
   editing (or if you go to the wrong URL after editing), you may need to
   set the FullUrl configuration variable.  A sample setting for this
   variable would be $FullUrl = "http://www.mysite.com/cgi-bin/mywiki.pl".

5. If saving a page takes more than 20-30 seconds, it is possible that
   there is a problem with the hostname lookup step.  Try setting the
   $UseLookup configuration variable to 0.
