Upgrade instructions for UseModWiki 1.0
Last updated: September 11, 2003
See the INSTALL file for new installations.

Please email usemod@usemod.com with any questions, comments, or suggestions.

------
Upgrading from 0.90, 0.91, or 0.92:

1. Make a backup of your current wiki script and your database directory
   ($DataDir).

2. Copy the wiki.pl file to your cgi-bin directory, overwriting your
   old wiki script.  You may need to change the permissions on the
   new script file.

3. Edit the wiki script in your cgi-bin directory, and change the line
   reading: $DataDir     = "/tmp/mywikidb"; # Main wiki directory
   ...to point to your existing wiki database directory.

4. If you are using the "config"-file method for your wiki settings,
   you can stop here (if you accept the defaults for new settings).
   If you want to change these settings, copy the appropriate lines from
   the new settings below to your config file and change them there.

5. If you did *not* use the config-file method for your settings, change
   the settings in the new script to match your old script.

Note that the default settings enable the "free-links" feature.  If you
want to continue using a "traditional" wiki (that does not allow free-links),
you should change $FreeLinks to 0. 

------
Upgrading from older versions (before 0.90) is possible, but requires
a conversion utility for the database.  Contact usemod@usemod.com for
upgrade instructions.
